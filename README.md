# Unclosed Parenthesis in Function Definition

This repository demonstrates a common Python error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  The error is subtle and can be easily missed, especially in larger codebases.

## Bug Description
The code in `bug.py` contains a function definition with an unclosed parenthesis. This results in a `SyntaxError` when the code is executed.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.py` file provides the corrected code with the parenthesis properly closed. 

This example highlights the importance of careful code review and using a good IDE or linter to catch such syntax errors early on.
